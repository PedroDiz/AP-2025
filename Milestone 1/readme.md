# Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**, including `torch`, `timm`, `tqdm`, and any other required dependencies.

2. **Run `train_efficientnet.py`**, which trains the model. This script internally executes `preparedata.py` to handle data preprocessing and setup.
